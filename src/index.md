## Main web site
This web site is a demo site for my own makefile site generator, called makefile-site-generator.
The project is a makefile for generating a nice static site: blazing fast, minimum dependencies.
It is based on the following articles:

- https://itnext.io/glorious-makefile-building-your-static-website-4e7cdc32d985
- https://www.karl.berlin/static-site.html

The template engine is based on [pandoc templates](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates) so you can employ metadata and so on

## Basic usage

On every page you can add a set of metdata like a list of authors and categories (see index.md for an example).
